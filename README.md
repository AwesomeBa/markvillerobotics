# Markville Robotics Website
This is a website for Markville Robotics. It will be used for various functions, such as resource sharing, advertisment, and recordkeeping.

# Contribution 
Please use Jekyll. We aren't quite sure how to do that yet.

# Branches
Upon the suggestion of experienced web designers, we use 2 branches: develop, and master. Develop is used (as the name suggests) for the development of pages. Please send pull requests to that branch. We use master to host the website, so we will push develop to master periodically.
