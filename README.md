# Markville Robotics Website
This is a website for Markville Robotics. It will be used for various functions, such as resource sharing, advertisment, and recordkeeping.

## Issues
Find a issue with the webpages? Make a issue report (click that 'issues' tab).

## Contribution 
We use Jekyll. That means posts should be created in a Markdown + HTML + Liquid format with YAML front matters. See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a posting guide that is applicable to our website. Please refer to [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) webpage to learn more about writing Jekyll compatible posts. You shouldn't have to touch anything other than the posts.

When develop is being pushed to master, use "Update" as the name of the push!

## Branches
Upon the suggestion of experienced web designers, we use 2 branches: develop, and master. Develop is used (as the name suggests) for the development of pages. Please send pull requests to that branch. We use master to host the website, so we will push develop to master periodically.
