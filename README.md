# Markville Robotics Website
This is a website for Markville Robotics. It will be used for various functions, such as resource sharing, advertisment, and recordkeeping.

# Issues
Find a issue with the webpages? Make a issue report (click that 'issues' tab).

# Contribution 
Please use Jekyll. We aren't quite sure how to do that yet. Currently, most of the development happens on a guess and check basis. Please excuse broken segments and spaghetti code. When develop is being pushed to master, used "Update" as the name of the push!

# Branches
Upon the suggestion of experienced web designers, we use 2 branches: develop, and master. Develop is used (as the name suggests) for the development of pages. Please send pull requests to that branch. We use master to host the website, so we will push develop to master periodically.
