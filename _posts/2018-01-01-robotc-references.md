At Markville Robotics, we use VEX Cortex robots. These must be programmed in the RobotC programming language. You should have already downloaded, installed, and set up the RobotC IDE using [these](https://markvillerobotics.github.io/resources/0001/01/01/how-to-install-robotc.html) instructions. 

We covered programming in RobotC during an in-club lessons, which will soon be availible in the lessons section. However, a simple tutorial is availible [here](http://www.robotc.net/tutor/Cortex/cortexunits.php?platform=Cortex).

Once you know how to code in RobotC, it is useful to have a reference of the methods that you will need to use. RobotC-specific methods are called Natural Language. A quick guide is availible [here](http://cdn.robotc.net/pdfs/natural-language/NL_Cortex_Quick.pdf], and a more comprehensive guide is availible [here](http://cdn.robotc.net/pdfs/natural-language/Natural_Language_Cortex.pdf)
