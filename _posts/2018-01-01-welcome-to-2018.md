Hello welcome to 2018!
Brrrrrrrr. Isn't it cold out here?

Anyways, meetings will exist as usual once we return to school. We will jump right into full out contest robot building, as the contest is coming quick in May. 

Website update: Now that most of the website mechanisms are somewhat functional, we can get to importing in the little content we have and creating new content.

We wish you a Happy New Year, and good luck with your New Year's resolutions.
