Hello,

All robotics club meetings are cancelled until February 6th of 2018.
We'll see you then!

Also, we need to let Skills Ontario know about team members. There will be 4 people who are actually registered for the contest. They will drive the robots and go through the judged interviews (think DECA). The rest of the team will be coming to spectate. (Transportation will be provided).
One of those 4 people could be you. Interested? (Email us)[markvillerobotics@gmail.com]!

Thanks,
Markville Robotics
