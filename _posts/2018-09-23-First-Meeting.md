Hello There!

Due to the overwhelmingly large number of applicants for the robotics team, we will be hosting our first meeting in the cafeteria 
on September 25, 2018, from 3 pm to 4 pm. We will be giving an introduction to the VEX robotics system, which the parts system we use. We will also be giving an introduction to the hardware and software subteams, as well as the differences between the two.

If you wish to refer a friend to sign up for Markville Robotics, tell them to sign up at http://bit.ly/mssrobotics2018 so we can add them to our email list.
Alternatively, they can visit our website at markvillerobotics.tk to find our signup link and other robotics resources.

Hope to see you at our first meeting!
