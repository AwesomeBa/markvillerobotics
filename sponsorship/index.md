## Sponsorship
Markville Robotics Club is a student-led organization within Markville Secondary School. It provides opportunities for students in the school interested in developing skills around robotics and Computer Engineering.  We will be participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition in the 2018 - 2019 school year.

The FIRST Robotics Competition is one of the world’s largest, most renowned robotics competitions, and it doesn't only test our robotic skills. The competition is run by For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST), which is a global charity that encourages STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) across the world. As a FIRST Robotics team, we are expected to run community outreach events, work as a team, operate the robot successfully, and create our “team brand”. In addition, we are required to find our own sources of funding to pay for the registration and attendance to two contests.

We need your support!

## Our Goal
$ 10 000 CAD !
This consists of $ 6 500 for basic registration at FIRST Ontario, $ 1 300 for another contest placement, and then $ 2 200 for the robot itself.

## Every Cent Helps! 
Even though we will need a grand $ 10 000, we will extremely grateful for any amount of money that you can donate.
